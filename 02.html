                Like all higher beings who wish to mingle amongst mortals, there is a modus vivendi that must be followed. 
                For cosmic entities, an anchor is necessary to maintain the corporeal form, and for Xiao Wu, that anchor is his doppleganger. 
                Residing on the opposide of the globe, his evil twin made his mark as the ruthless dictator of North Korea. 
                He and his twin form the two jaws of the clamp which anchors them to planet Earth. 
                <br><br>
                Make no mistake, it is not that Xiao is incapable of darkness, but rather that he has cast all of it into his clone. 
                Experts believe this is part of a calculated strategy to eventually take over the world, though nobody has managed to work out a timeline.
                For all we know, the plan may already be underway...
