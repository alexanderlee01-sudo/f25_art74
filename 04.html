                Recently, scientists have made a breakthrough discovery, which has changed the outlook of this entire study.
                This latest research indicates that the final phase of Xiao is a protector. He is known as the Conqueror of Demons, the Guardian Yaksha,
                which was previously understood to be an opponent of Xiao, rather than a component of Xiao himself. We know now that they are one and the same,
                but it doesn't manifest itself until the final test is passed. 
                <br><br>
                This is the last glimmer of hope for humanity, and the crux of the research. A total of 489 scientists have heroically dedicated themselves to the cause; 
                chiefly among them, Sir Nigel Farage and his experiments on 20,000 Arab women, Dr. Kristi Noem and her blood sacrifice of 150,000 puppies, 
                and of course, Dr. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and his research on disseminating deadly infectious agents among 70 million children.
                Do not let their bravery go to waste; share this knowledge with your friends, family, and loved ones. Let them know that there is light at the end of the tunnel.
                Let them know that Xiao is not our enemy, he is our friend and savior.
