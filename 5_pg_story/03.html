                But hark! For death is not the end, it is merely the beginning of the end. The Rapture will not ease your suffering, 
                because waiting for you at the gates of hell is Xiao Wu himself. This time, it is neither his good self nor his evil self, 
                but rather his true self. You face the judgement of the cosmic being, in all his glory and horror. 
                <br><br>
                Do not mistake him for a petty deity; he is not God, Allah, or the Buddha. He is much, much more. 
                His judgements cannot be found on any written scripture, for his thoughts are so beyond human comprehension, any attempt to 
                transcribe them would surely lead to your peril. No, his rubric lies on a canvas in the clouds. 
                Only he knows whether you pass or fail. 
                <br><br>
                For those who fail, you become the fuel for his fire. He consumes your very being, and it will be as if you were never born
                into this universe in the first place. Your ashes will be harder to find than the Epstein client list. 
                <br><br>
                But for those who pass, well...
